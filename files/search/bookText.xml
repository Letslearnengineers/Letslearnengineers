               geographic methodology in epidemiology.
               His study of the distribution of cholera led
               to  the  source  of  the  disease,  a
               contaminated  water  pump  (the  Broad
               Street    Pump,     whose    handle     he
               disconnected,    thus   terminating    the

               the  basic  elements  of  topography  and

               the  John  Snow  map  was  unique,  using
               cartographic  methods  not  only  to  depict
               but    also   to   analyze   clusters   of

               Growth of GIS

               The year 1960 saw the development of the
               world's  first  true  operational  GIS  in
               Ottawa,  Ontario,  Canada  by  the  federal
               Department  of  Forestry  and  Rural
               Development.  Developed  by  Dr.  Roger

               Tomlinson,  it  was  called  the  Canada
               Geographic Information System (CGIS) and         Early 1980s
               was used to store, analyze, and manipulate
               data  collected  for  the  Canada  Land          •  M&S  Computing  along  with  Bentley

               public domain systems (MOSS and GRASS
               GIS)  began  in  the  late  1970s  and  early

               that  required  for  mixing  of  concrete.
               Therefore the requirement of the quantity
               of water for curing is to be kept in mind.
               Ideology  -  While  designing  the  concrete

               minimum  cement  content  stands  at
               320kg/cu.m  for  M20  grade  of  concrete.
               There is a widespread perception that the

               generally  made  by  varying  the  water
               cement ratio. And in a fewer cases the trail
               mixes  are  made  by  varying  the  cement
               content. But this trial is being started from

               the maximum cement content varied in a
               decreasing order by a few kilograms.


                                                                       Such  trials  were  made  at  site  by

                                                                keeping  the  cement  content  a  constant.
                                                                Also  the  tests  were  done  with  different
                                                                cement and coarse aggregate proportions

                1.)  Why should we limit us to one trial mix           Surprisingly   the    Compressive

               charge of water cement ratio.
                       These results had made me frame a
               opinion that the cement is just a binding
               material. Aggregates are generally thought
               of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But
               a  closer  look  reveals  the  major  role  and
               influence aggregate plays in the properties      Hence  there  is  urgent  need  to  shift  our

               Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit         proportion in a concrete mix to increasing

               concrete mix.                                    strength.













                       Economy  is  another  reason  for
               thoughtful  aggregate  selection.  You  can
               often  save  money  by  selecting  the
               maximum allowable aggregate size. Using
               larger  coarse  aggregate  typically  lowers
               the  cost  of  a  concrete  mix  by  reducing
               cement  requirements,  the  most  costly
               ingredient. Less cement (within reasonable
               limits for durability) will mean less water if

               the  water-cement  (w/c)  ratio  is  kept
               constant.  A  lower  water  content  will
               reduce the potential for shrinkage and for
               cracking associated with restrained volume
